# Canon Change Control

This document defines how canon within *The Wellings* project may be modified,
extended, or locked over time.

It exists to prevent silent drift, ambiguity, or retroactive reinterpretation.

---

## 1. Definition of Canon

Canon is defined exclusively by the contents of the `/canon` directory.

If something is not documented in `/canon`, it does not exist within the project.

---

## 2. Authority

The project author is the sole authority for:
- Creating canon
- Modifying canon
- Locking canon
- Retiring canon

AI assistance may draft or suggest changes but **cannot** independently alter canon.

---

## 3. Canon Modification Rules

A canon file may be modified only if **all** of the following are true:

1. The change is intentional and explicit  
2. The change is written directly into the relevant canon file  
3. The change does not contradict higher-order canon (e.g., rules override concepts)

If a contradiction is discovered, resolution must occur in canon before proceeding.

---

## 4. Promotion from Conceptual to Canon

Materials in `/conceptual` are non-canonical by default.

Promotion to canon requires:
- Explicit intent to promote
- Creation or update of a canon document reflecting the promoted content
- Optional relocation or duplication of assets into `/canon/locked` if applicable

Conceptual artifacts may remain after promotion for historical reference.

---

## 5. Canon Locking

When a canon area is considered stable, it may be locked.

Locked canon:
- May not be altered without explicit unlock
- Serves as a long-term anchor for consistency

Locked canon files are stored under:
/canon/locked/


---

## 6. Versioning and Archives

Delivered ZIP archives (e.g., `canon-pack-vX.Y.zip`) are snapshots for reference only.

**Completion of a PATH may justify a canon freeze or version bump but does not require one.**

They do not supersede the current project folder state unless explicitly declared.


---

## 7. Absence Rule

If a rule, character trait, visual constraint, environment detail, or structural rule
is not documented in canon, it must be treated as undefined.

Undefined is not implied.

---

## 8. Scope

This document governs:
- Story canon
- Visual canon
- Structural canon
- Governance rules

It does not govern production tooling, distribution platforms, or marketing execution.
