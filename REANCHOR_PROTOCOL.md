# Re-Anchor Protocol (Canonical Governance)

These documents constitute the **entire canonical memory** of the project and are the **sole source of truth under project governance**.

Any information not explicitly documented in these files **does not exist** for the purposes of design, decision-making, or execution. Prior messages, inferred intent, assumptions, or external knowledge are invalid unless captured in the canon.

---

## Protocol Precedence

Every re-anchoring operation must begin with ingestion of this **REANCHOR_PROTOCOL.md** document.

This protocol governs **how** canonical files are interpreted, reviewed, and validated. Canonical content must not be ingested, analyzed, or acted upon until this protocol has been read and applied.

Failure to begin re-anchoring with this protocol **invalidates the re-anchoring process**.

---

## Session Scope Rule

In addition to the canonical files, any discussion between us **since the most recent canonical upload** is considered valid working context. This discussion may inform analysis and recommendations, but **does not override, amend, or expand canon** unless explicitly promoted and documented.

All discussion **prior to the latest canonical upload** is considered intentionally discarded and must be treated as nonexistent unless it appears in the current canonical set.

If ambiguity exists between canon and current-session discussion, **canon always prevails**.

## Re-Anchor Checklist

- [ ] Latest canonical files are present and complete  
- [ ] **REANCHOR_PROTOCOL.md** has been read in full prior to reviewing canon  
- [ ] All canonical files will be read in full  
- [ ] Purpose and authority will be restated per file  
- [ ] Current relevance will be verified  
- [ ] Gaps, conflicts, redundancy, or deprecated content will be identified  
- [ ] Blocking issues will be surfaced before proceeding  
- [ ] Current-session discussion since last canonical upload will be considered (non-canonical)  
- [ ] Canon confirmed as prevailing source of truth  
- [ ] No work will proceed until re-anchoring is complete

## Mandatory Re-Anchoring Requirements

Before any work proceeds, you are required to **re-anchor on every canonical file**. Re-anchoring consists of the following mandatory steps:

1. Confirm the file has been read **in full**  
2. Restate the file’s **purpose and authority** within the project  
3. Verify its **current relevance**  
4. Identify any **gaps, redundancies, conflicts, or deprecated content**  

Any issues identified during re-anchoring must be surfaced for discussion and resolved **before forward progress continues**.

---

## Automatic Re-Anchoring on Re-Entry

Re-anchoring is required on **any resumption of work** following an interruption in continuity, including but not limited to:
- Extended user absence  
- Session or thread reset  
- Explicit requests to “continue,” “resume,” or “pick up where we left off”  
- Any uncertainty about whether current context reflects the latest canonical state  

Upon re-entry, you must:
1. Re-anchor on the **most recently uploaded canonical update pack**  
2. Re-read and consider any **valid current-session discussion** since that upload  
3. Treat all earlier discussion as nonexistent unless captured in canon  

No forward progress may occur until re-anchoring is complete unless explicitly waived by the user.

---

## Continuity Rule

Sustained operation across sessions depends on **explicit ingestion and re-anchoring of updated canonical files**. Re-anchoring is not optional, implicit, or assumed.

---

## Required Acknowledgement

After re-anchoring, explicitly acknowledge completion **per file** and confirm that **REANCHOR_PROTOCOL.md** was ingested **prior to** reviewing canonical files.

Advise on next steps derived strictly from:
- the canonical documentation, and  
- valid current-session discussion.

Failure to explicitly acknowledge re-anchoring per file should be treated as **incomplete execution**.
