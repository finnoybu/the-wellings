# Conceptual Materials

This folder contains conceptual, exploratory, and draft materials
for *The Wellings* franchise.

Files in this directory express intent and direction only; they do not define canon.

All contents in this folder are **non-binding**.

They are intended to:
- explore visual ideas
- test tone and composition
- guide future development

They do NOT define:
- canon characters
- canon environments
- narrative events
- spatial layouts
- story progression

---

## COVER CONCEPTS

Back cover art is conceptual and intended as a shared template.
The cat (Miso) and butterfly pose may vary by book.

Cover images in this folder are symbolic.

They may:
- suggest emotional tone
- reinforce set themes
- explore visual continuity across books

They must NOT:
- be treated as literal scenes
- introduce story facts
- override manuscript text
- define environment layouts

Visual progression across covers is symbolic only.

Back cover templates may include symbolic character variation
that does not reflect canonical behavior.


---

## PROMOTION TO CANON

Conceptual materials may only become canon if:
- explicitly reviewed
- explicitly approved
- explicitly documented in canon files

Until that occurs, all conceptual materials remain provisional.

---

## REVISION

Conceptual materials may be:
- revised
- replaced
- removed

without violating canon.

Absence of promotion is intentional.

Frontmatter concepts apply across books unless otherwise noted.
