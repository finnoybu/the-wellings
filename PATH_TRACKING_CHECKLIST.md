# Project Path Tracking Checklist — The Wellings

This document tracks approved production paths for *The Wellings* project.

Each PATH represents a bounded scope of work.
Paths may be completed in any order, but steps within a path must be completed sequentially.

Completion of a PATH may justify a canon freeze or version bump.
Incomplete steps must not be assumed complete.

---

## PATH A — Production Readiness for Set One (Books 1–6)

**Goal:**  
Make Set One fully illustratable and production-ready without ambiguity.

This path does NOT introduce new story content, interiors, or marketing assets.

### Step A1 — Canonical Environment Usage List (Set One)
- [X] Identify all environments implied by Books 1–6
- [ ] Name environments minimally (labels only)
- [ ] Confirm no interiors are included
- [ ] Confirm no new locations are invented
- [ ] Document environments for Set One only

**Deliverable:**  
Set One Environment Usage List (documented)

---

### Step A2 — Environment Reuse Rules
- [ ] Define which environments may repeat across pages
- [ ] Define which environments may repeat across books
- [ ] Define which environments are transitional only
- [ ] Explicitly forbid unintended continuity
- [ ] Document reuse rules clearly

**Deliverable:**  
Environment Reuse Rules (documented)

---

### Step A3 — Set One Cover Progression Lock
- [ ] Define symbolic progression (distance → approach → porch → door open)
- [ ] Confirm progression applies to covers only
- [ ] Confirm progression is non-narrative
- [ ] Lock progression for Books 1–6
- [ ] Document progression rules

**Deliverable:**  
Set One Cover Progression Rules (documented)

---

### Step A4 — Page-Level Illustration Checklists (Books 1–6)
- [ ] Create one checklist per book
- [ ] For each page, record:
  - characters present
  - environment label
  - implied time-of-day (if any)
  - continuity notes
- [ ] Avoid art-direction language
- [ ] Verify alignment with manuscripts

**Deliverable:**  
Page-Level Illustration Checklists (Books 1–6)

---

### Step A5 — Illustration Director Prompt Template
- [ ] Draft template using:
  - canon files
  - environment rules
  - page-level checklists
- [ ] Ensure template is reusable and non-artistic
- [ ] Validate against one sample page (dry run)
- [ ] Finalize template

**Deliverable:**  
Illustration Director Prompt Template

---

### Step A6 — Production Freeze (Optional)
- [ ] Confirm all Path A steps complete
- [ ] Decide whether to freeze Set One
- [ ] If freezing:
  - assemble canon-pack v1.0
  - record freeze decision

**Deliverable:**  
Optional canon-pack v1.0.zip

---

## PATH B — Interior Canon Expansion (Phase 1)

**Goal:**  
Introduce interior environments intentionally without breaking existing books.

This path modifies canon and must be carefully controlled.

### Step B1 — Interior Scope Definition
- [ ] Decide number of interior spaces (max 2–3)
- [ ] Name interior spaces
- [ ] Confirm which books introduce each space
- [ ] Confirm interiors do not retroactively affect earlier books

---

### Step B2 — Canon Environment Update
- [ ] Update CANON_ENVIRONMENTS.md explicitly
- [ ] Add interiors as canon
- [ ] Maintain exterior-only rules for other spaces
- [ ] Validate no contradictions

---

### Step B3 — Continuity & First-Appearance Rules
- [ ] Define first-appearance constraints
- [ ] Define reuse limitations
- [ ] Document interior continuity rules

---

## PATH C — Cover & Marketing System

**Goal:**  
Prepare consistent visual assets for web, listings, and promotion.

This path does NOT affect story canon.

### Step C1 — Marketing Visual Categories
- [ ] Define categories (web hero, listings, social, etc.)
- [ ] Document intended usage per category

---

### Step C2 — Marketing Visual Governance
- [ ] Create CONCEPTUAL_MARKETING_VISUALS.md
- [ ] Define non-canon status
- [ ] Define reuse and variation rules

---

### Step C3 — Back Cover Iteration
- [ ] Iterate back cover concept to v1
- [ ] Preserve conceptual status
- [ ] Validate consistency with visual style canon

---

### Step C4 — Open-Book Illustration System
- [ ] Define per-book open-book illustration intent
- [ ] Document reuse pattern across books
- [ ] Keep system non-narrative

---

## PATH D — Book Architecture Audit (Books 1–12)

**Goal:**  
Ensure structural consistency across existing and future books.

This path does not change story content.

### Step D1 — Manuscript Structure Review
- [ ] Review page counts for Books 1–12
- [ ] Check pacing symmetry
- [ ] Identify structural drift

---

### Step D2 — Normalization Rules
- [ ] Define acceptable page-count ranges
- [ ] Define consistent book rhythm
- [ ] Document normalization guidance

---

### Step D3 — Future Book Architecture Template
- [ ] Create template for Books 13–24
- [ ] Define required fields and structure
- [ ] Validate template against existing books

---

## Notes

- Paths may be paused and resumed.
- Canon changes require re-anchoring.
- If a step is not documented, it is not complete.
- If a rule is not documented, it does not exist.
