# Set One Cover Progression  
**Applies to:** Set One — *The Days We Come Home* (Books 1–6)

This document defines the canonical cover progression for Set One.

It exists to ensure visual consistency, emotional clarity, and intentional movement across the first six books.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Set One cover sequence represents a gradual **return home**.

The progression is:
- Emotional first
- Spatial second
- Never interior-facing

Covers must communicate welcome, patience, and belonging without depicting plot or scenes from inside the books.

---

## 2. Fixed Constraints

The following constraints apply to **all Set One covers**:

- All covers are exterior scenes
- The Welling house is present on every cover
- No interior spaces are shown
- No new locations are introduced
- Characters are always outdoors
- Covers are symbolic, not narrative illustrations

---

## 3. Canonical Progression by Book

### Book 1 — *The Wellings and the Very Busy Day*  
**State:** Distant Return  

**Description:**
- The Welling house is visible in the background
- Characters are outside, oriented toward the reader
- Emphasis is on welcome and introduction
- The house is present but not yet approached

### Book 2  
**State:** Approach Begins  

**Description:**
- Characters are closer to the house than in Book 1

- Movement suggests progress, not arrival

### Fixed Background Rule

All Set One covers share the same background environment.

This includes:
- The Welling house

The background must remain visually identical across Books 1–6.

Only the characters may change position, orientation, or distance relative to the house.

**State:** Nearing Home  

**Description:**
- Characters are clearly on the path toward the house

- Emotional tone remains calm and patient

---

### Book 4  
**State:** Almost There  

**Description:**
- Characters are close to the porch or front of the house

- Still no interior visibility

---

### Book 5  
**State:** At the Threshold  

**Description:**
- Characters are at or just before the porch
- The house fills the background
- The moment suggests pause, not completion

---

### Book 6  
**State:** Belonging  

**Description:**
- Characters are fully arrived
- The porch is the primary setting
- The door may be open
