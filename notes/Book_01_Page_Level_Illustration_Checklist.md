# Book 1 — Page-Level Illustration Checklist  
**Title:** *The Wellings and the Very Busy Day*  
**Path:** PATH A — Step A4  
**Purpose:** Define what must be illustrated per page (structural, non-artistic)

This checklist is derived directly from the Book 1 CSV and is fully aligned with current canon.
It specifies *what* must appear per page, not *how* it should be illustrated.

---

## Global Constraints (Apply to Every Page)

- Environments must be limited to:
  - **Welling House — Front Yard**
  - **Open Outdoor Space**
  - **Neighborhood Path** (only if implied)
- No interiors
- No new locations
- Characters must match the CSV exactly
- Emotional continuity takes priority over spatial continuity
- Illustrations should support calm observation, not action spectacle
