# Set One — Environment Reuse Rules  
*(Books 1–6: The Days We Come Home)*

This document defines how environments listed in
`Set_One_Environment_Usage_List.md` may be reused, varied, or constrained
across illustrations in **Set One** of *The Wellings* series.

These rules exist to prevent unintended continuity, spatial inference,
or environmental drift during illustration and production.

---

## Scope

- Applies **only** to Set One (Books 1–6)
- Applies **only** to environments defined in:
  - `Set_One_Environment_Usage_List.md`
- Does **not** introduce new environments, interiors, or visual detail
- Does **not** define art direction or stylistic choices

---

## Reusable Environments

The following environments **may be reused** across:
- multiple pages within a single book
- multiple books within Set One

Reuse does **not** imply visual sameness or spatial continuity.

### Reusable
- **Welling House — Front Yard**
- **Neighborhood Path**
- **Open Outdoor Space**

### Reuse Rules
- Reuse may vary:
  - camera distance
  - character placement
  - implied time-of-day (if supported by the manuscript)
- Reuse must **not** establish:
  - fixed geography
  - landmarks
  - consistent spatial orientation across pages or books

---

## Transitional-Only Environment

The following environment is **transitional in nature**:

### Transitional
- **Welling House — Porch**

### Transitional Rules
- May appear multiple times across Set One
- Must function as:
  - arrival
  - pause
  - waiting
  - departure
- Must **not**:
  - imply interior visibility
  - imply interior access
  - become a dominant or primary setting

---

## Background-Only Environment

The following environment is **background-only**:

### Background-Only
- **Street Edge**

### Background Rules
- May appear as contextual backdrop
- Must never be the focal setting
- Must never host primary action or emotional beats

---

## Non-Continuity Rule (Critical)

Across all environments in Set One:

- Reuse **does not imply**:
  - the same physical location
  - consistent layout
  - fixed orientation
- Each illustration is **contextual**, not cartographic
- Continuity is emotional and narrative, **not spatial**

---

## Forbidden Inference

Illustrators and generators must **not infer**:
- unseen rooms or interiors
- adjacent buildings
- neighborhood layout
- consistent distances between locations

If an inference is required, the environment must remain **generic**.

---

## Forward Compatibility

- These rules apply **only** to Set One
- Future sets may:
  - refine reuse rules
  - introduce interiors intentionally
  - add spatial continuity by design
- No future rule applies retroactively unless canon is explicitly amended

---

## Governance

This document is canon and governed by:
- `CANON_RULES.md`
- `CANON_CHANGE_CONTROL.md`

Any modification requires explicit intent and documentation.
