# CONCEPTUAL_COVER_DIRECTION.md

This document describes conceptual visual direction for cover art
within *The Wellings* franchise.

All guidance in this document is **non-binding**.
Conceptual direction informs tone and cohesion only.
It does not define canonical events, spatial layouts, or story moments.

---

## PURPOSE OF COVER ART

Cover art in *The Wellings* serves to:
- establish emotional tone
- reinforce thematic continuity across sets
- invite the reader into a quiet moment

Covers are symbolic rather than literal.
They gesture toward feeling, not narrative action.

---

## SET ONE — COVER CONCEPT

### **The Days We Come Home**

Set One covers may share a consistent exterior environment
associated with the Welling family home.

This environment functions as a visual anchor,
not as a mapped or repeatable location.

---

### Visual Progression (Symbolic Only)

Across Books 1–6, covers may suggest a gentle progression:

- Early covers may place the characters farther from the house
- Later covers may place the characters nearer the house
- Final covers may suggest arrival or welcome

This progression represents:
- return
- settling
- familiarity

It does **not** represent:
- sequential events
- literal movement through space
- changes occurring within the story text

---

### Character Presence on Covers

Covers may include:
- Arthur Welling
- Eleanor Welling
- Oliver Welling
- Miso

Characters may appear:
- in varied poses
- with subtle shifts in orientation
- interacting quietly with the environment

Expressions and posture must remain:
- calm
- gentle
- non-dramatic

---

### Repetition and Variation

Covers within a set may reuse:
- similar background elements
- consistent framing
- recurring visual motifs

Variation should be introduced through:
- character positioning
- distance
- posture
- orientation

Not through:
- changes in environment canon
- added narrative details
- implied events

---

## AUTHOR NAME AND TYPOGRAPHY (NON-CANON)

Author name placement and typography are treated as:
- design elements
- not narrative content

Typography choices do not define tone within the story itself
and may change without affecting canon.

---

## RULES FOR CONCEPTUAL COVER ART

- Cover art must never override manuscript text
- Cover imagery must not introduce story facts
- Conceptual progression must remain symbolic
- No cover should imply resolution or conclusion

Covers invite the reader in.
They do not explain what happens next.

---

## STATUS

All guidance in this document may be revised, replaced,
or removed without violating canon.

Conceptual cover direction is intended to evolve
alongside the franchise.
