# CANON_ENVIRONMENTS.md

This document defines the canonical status of environments
within *The Wellings* franchise.

Environments are treated as emotional contexts rather than
fully specified physical spaces.

Unless explicitly stated, environments are intentionally undefined.

## Canon Environment Scope

At present, only the following environments are canon:

- The Wellings’ House — exterior only
- Sofia Linden’s House — exterior only

No interior spaces are canon at this time.
All interior depictions are considered non-canon unless explicitly added to canon.

---

## CANONICAL ENVIRONMENTS (DEFINED)

### Wellings House — Interior Reference Status

Floorplan images for the Wellings house exist as canonical spatial reference only.

These plans:
- Define layout and relative room positioning
- Do NOT grant automatic permission for interior illustrations
- Do NOT imply interior scenes appear in Set One

Interior usage must be explicitly introduced and canonized in a future phase.

### Welling House — Exterior Only

**Status:** Canon  
**Scope:** Exterior only  

The Welling family home exterior is canon.

**Canonical characteristics:**
- Feels welcoming and familiar
- Residential, modest, and grounded
- Neither grand nor rundown
- Suggests stability and warmth

The exterior may be shown:
- from the front yard
- from a distance
- as a place of return

The following are **not canon** and must not be inferred:
- interior layout
- number of rooms
- furniture
- floor plan
- specific interior landmarks

The house represents *home as a feeling*, not a structure to be mapped.

### Sofia Linden’s House — Exterior Only

**Status:** Canon  
**Scope:** Exterior only  

Sofia Linden’s home exterior is canon.

**Canonical characteristics:**
- Calm and quietly welcoming
- Suggests care and gentleness
- Distinct from the Welling home without contrast or conflict

The exterior may imply:
- warmth
- safety
- continuity across generations

The following are **not canon** and must not be inferred:
- interior layout
- room usage
- décor
- surrounding neighborhood details

---

## ENVIRONMENTS — INTENTIONALLY UNDEFINED

The following environment categories are **not yet canon**:

- All interior spaces
- Schools
- Shops or public buildings
- Parks, streets, or neighborhoods
- Specific towns or geographic regions
- Recurring landmarks
- Maps or spatial continuity

These environments may appear descriptively in stories,
but must remain:
- flexible
- non-specific
- non-recurring

No fixed layouts or repeatable spatial rules
may be introduced without explicit author approval.

---

## COVER ART AND SYMBOLIC ENVIRONMENTS

Cover imagery may depict environments symbolically.

Such depictions:
- are emotional rather than literal
- do not define canonical geography
- must not be treated as scene documentation

Cover art environments must never override
the textual canon defined in manuscripts and rules.

---

## ENVIRONMENT CANON RULES

- Environments exist to support mood, not plot
- No environment should demand explanation
- Specificity must never limit future stories
- Absence of detail is intentional, not incomplete

Environments in *The Wellings* are places to be felt,
not places to be mapped.
