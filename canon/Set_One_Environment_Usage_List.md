# Set One — Canonical Environment Usage List  
*(Books 1–6: The Days We Come Home)*

This document defines the canonical environment labels used in **Set One** of *The Wellings* series (Books 1–6).

It exists to constrain illustration and production work by naming only the environments explicitly or implicitly present in the manuscripts.

This document does not introduce new locations, interiors, or visual detail.

---

## Scope

- Applies **only** to Set One (Books 1–6)
- Uses **labels only**, not descriptions or layouts
- Includes **no interior environments**
- Introduces **no new locations**
- Serves as a prerequisite for illustration and production planning

---

## Canonical Environment Labels

### Primary Exterior Environment

1. **Welling House — Front Yard**  
   Exterior space immediately surrounding the Welling house.

---

### Transitional Exterior Environment

2. **Welling House — Porch**  
   Exterior threshold space associated with arrival, waiting, or pause.  
   Does not imply interior visibility or access.

---

### Movement / Journey Environments (Abstracted)

3. **Neighborhood Path**  
   Generic walking path or sidewalk.  
   No landmarks, no named neighbors, no specificity.

4. **Street Edge**  
   Implied roadway presence.  
   Background-only environment; never the focal setting.

---

### Flexible / Non-Specific Exterior Environment

5. **Open Outdoor Space**  
   Used when the manuscript implies “outside” without a defined location.  
   Must remain generic and interchangeable.

---

## Explicit Exclusions (Current Canon Scope)

The following environments do **not** exist in canon **yet**.  
They may be introduced intentionally in later paths or future sets.

- Interior environments (rooms, hallways, kitchens, etc.)
- Named public places (school, park, store, library, etc.)
- Season-defined or weather-defined environments
- Illustration-only locations introduced for visual convenience

Absence from this list indicates *not yet canon*, not forbidden.

## Notes

- Inclusion in this list does **not** imply visual continuity.
- Reuse, variation, and continuity rules are defined separately.
- This document constrains illustration inputs but does not dictate art direction.
