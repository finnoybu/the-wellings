In addition to being the canon files, these files are to act as your long term memory for the project & it is mandated by our governance rule that these documents are the only source of truth for the project. If something is not documented, it does not exist within this project. If there is anything you believe is missing, is redundant, or no longer has value, we should discuss that before moving forward. The only way we can operate for long periods of time is to have you regularly ingest the updated canonical files. Please confirm the latest files, re-anchor & advise on next steps.
