# CANON VISUAL STYLE

This document defines the canonical visual constraints for *The Wellings*.
It governs all illustrations unless explicitly marked as conceptual.

This file restricts variation. It does not prescribe technique.

---

## 1. Line Art

- Black-and-white only.
- Clean, consistent line weight.
- No heavy shading, gradients, or cross-hatching.
- Detail should support clarity, not realism.

---

## 2. Tone and Expression

- Calm, warm, observational.
- Emotions are gentle and readable, never exaggerated.
- Humor (when present) is subtle, not slapstick.

---

## 3. Character Depiction

- Characters must match their canonical descriptions.
- No caricature, distortion, or cartoon physics.
- Proportions remain consistent across books.

---

## 4. Environment Depiction

- Environments are grounded and familiar.
- Exterior-only unless interior canon is explicitly introduced.
- Backgrounds support the moment; they do not dominate it.

---

## 5. Continuity

- Visual continuity across books in a set is intentional.
- Small variations in pose, framing, or staging are allowed.
- Core visual identity must remain stable.

---

## 6. Non-Canon Visuals

- Any deviation from this style must be labeled as conceptual.
- Conceptual assets do not modify or extend canon.

---

## 7. Authority

If a conflict arises between visual output and this document,
this document takes precedence.
